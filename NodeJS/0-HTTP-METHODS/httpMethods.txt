■ What are HTTP Methods?
  => HTTP methods (also called HTTP verbs) are a set of request types defined by the HTTP protocol. 
     They tell the server what action the client (browser, mobile app, or API consumer) wants to perform on a given resource (like a user, product, or post).


■ Most Common HTTP Methods:
  => Here are the main ones you’ll use in APIs and web development:
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Method	                Use / Purpose	                                                                        Example     
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
     1. GET	    -> Retrieve data from the server (read-only).	                                          -> GET /users → fetch all users
     2. POST	  -> Send data to the server to create a new resource.	                                  -> POST /users → create a new user
     3. PUT	    -> Update an existing resource (replace it fully).	                                    -> PUT /users/5 → replace user with ID=5
     4. PATCH	  -> Update part of a resource (partial update).	                                        -> PATCH /users/5 → update only email of user 5
     5. DELETE  -> Remove a resource from the server.	                                                  -> DELETE /users/5 → delete user with ID=5
     6. HEAD	  -> Same as GET, but only fetches headers, not the body (useful for checking metadata).  -> HEAD /file.pdf
     7. OPTIONS -> Ask the server which HTTP methods are allowed for a resource (often used in CORS).	  -> OPTIONS /users
     8. TRACE	  -> Echoes the received request (used for debugging, rarely used in production).	        -> TRACE /test
     9. CONNECT -> Establish a tunnel to the server (commonly used in HTTPS, proxies).	                -> CONNECT www.example.com:443

✅ Why are they useful?
      • They define intent (are we reading, creating, updating, or deleting?).
      • Make APIs RESTful by mapping CRUD operations to methods:
              ┼ Create → POST
              ┼ Read → GET
              ┼ Update → PUT/PATCH
              ┼ Delete → DELETE

■ By Default, browser perform a GET request.
