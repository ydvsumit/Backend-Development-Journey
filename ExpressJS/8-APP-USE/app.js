/**
 * ðŸ”¹ What is app.use() in ExpressJS?
 *    - app.use() is a method to register middleware functions in your Express app.
 *
 * In other words â€”
 *          â€¢ ðŸ‘‰ It tells Express what function to run whenever a request comes in.
 *          â€¢ These functions can handle things like logging, authentication, data parsing, etc.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Syntax:   app.use([path], middlewareFunction)
 *            â€¢ path (optional) â†’ the URL path for which the middleware should run.
 *            â€¢ middlewareFunction â†’ the function that handles the request.

const express = require("express");
const logger = require("./middleware/logger");
const requestRecieved = require("./middleware/requestRecieved");

const app = express();

app.use(logger);

// ðŸ“Œ This middleware runs only for routes that start with /users,
// like /users, /users/123, etc.
app.use("/users", requestRecieved);
/**
 * Two important thing that we need to take care:
 * ðŸ”¹ Here, if i want to apply middleware in all route at one time instead of putting in every route individually,
 *    I need to use method app.use() and inside it I need to pass middleware and also in this invoking this method at which place and order matters.
 *    if we apply this method after one route or two route it will leave the above routes and started applying on next routes that declared after the app.use() statement.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ in app.use(path, middleware), we can give path that means, suppose that if give path like this "/api", that means any route that starts with /api it will automatically apply but we have to declare app.use() at top of the code.
 * ðŸ”¹ in app.use(middleware), it's apply bydefault to all routes (not a start with any specific path).
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ How it Works Internally
 *    ðŸ”´ When a request comes in:
 *        â€¢ Express checks all middlewares registered with app.use().
 *        â€¢ If the path matches (or if no path is defined, it matches all).
 *        â€¢ It executes the middleware in the order they are defined.
 *        â€¢ Each middleware calls next() to move to the next one.
