/**
 * ðŸ”¹ What is Express Router?
 *    - Express Router is a mini version of an Express app, used to organize your routes into separate files or modules.
 *
 * In simple words â€”
 * ðŸ‘‰ It helps you split your big Express app into smaller parts (like routes for users, products, orders, etc.)
 *    so your code becomes clean, modular, and easy to manage.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Why do we need it?
 *    - When your project grows, putting all routes in one server.js or app.js file becomes messy.
 *    - Thatâ€™s where express.Router() helps â€” it lets you create separate route files.
