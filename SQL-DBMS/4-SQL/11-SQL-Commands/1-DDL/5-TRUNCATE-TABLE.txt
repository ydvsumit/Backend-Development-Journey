🔥 TRUNCATE:
👉 In SQL, the TRUNCATE command belongs to DDL (Data Definition Language), and it is used to remove all rows (data) from a table very quickly, 
    but keeps the table structure so you can use it again.


💡 In simple words:
TRUNCATE = “Delete everything inside the table, but keep the empty table ready to use.”


📊 Example:

Before:
| id | name | marks |
| -- | ---- | ----- |
| 1  | John | 85    |
| 2  | Mary | 90    |


Command:
TRUNCATE TABLE students;


After:
| id        | name | marks |
| --------- | ---- | ----- |
| (no rows) |      |       |


✅ Table still exists, but it’s empty now.


⚙️ Key Points:
              • It removes all data instantly (faster than DELETE).
              • It does not log each row deletion individually → that’s why it’s fast.
              • It resets auto-increment values (e.g., ID starts again from 1).
              • You can’t use WHERE with TRUNCATE (it deletes everything).
              • Once executed, you can’t ROLLBACK (undo) it — in most databases.


✅ In short:

TRUNCATE quickly empties a table but keeps its structure for future use —
like clearing all pages of a notebook but keeping the notebook itself.
