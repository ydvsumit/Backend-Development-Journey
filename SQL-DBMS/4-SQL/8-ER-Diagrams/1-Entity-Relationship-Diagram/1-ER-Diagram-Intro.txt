📌 What is ER Diagram ?
👉 ER Diagram stands for Entity-Relationship Diagram.
👉 In simple words, an ER diagram is a picture (or visual map) that shows how data is organized and how different pieces of data (tables) are connected to each other in a database.

It helps you plan and understand the structure of your database before you actually create it.


📍 Main parts of an ER Diagram:

1. Entity → represents a real-world object or thing.
            • Example: Student, Teacher, Course, Department
            • In diagrams, entities are shown as rectangles.

2. Attribute → details or properties of an entity.
                • Example: For a Student → StudentID, Name, Age
                • In diagrams, attributes are shown as ovals connected to entities.

3. Relationship → shows how entities are linked or related.
                  🔹 Example:
                              • A Student “enrolls in” a Course
                              • A Teacher “teaches” a Course
                  🔹 In diagrams, relationships are shown as diamonds.

📊 Example:
Let’s say we have:
                  • Entity: Student
                  • Entity: Course
                  • Relationship: Enrolls

Then your ER diagram looks like this (visually):
                                                  [STUDENT] ---- (ENROLLS) ---- [COURSE]
Attributes:
          STUDENT: StudentID, Name, Age
          COURSE: CourseID, CourseName


🔗 Types of Relationships:

• One-to-One (1:1) → Each entity in A relates to one in B
                   → Example: One person → one passport

• One-to-Many (1:N) → One entity in A relates to many in B
                    → Example: One teacher → many students

• Many-to-Many (M:N) → Many in A relate to many in B
                     → Example: Students ↔ Courses


💡 In short:
            • ER Diagram = blueprint of your database.
            • It shows what data you have (entities), what details they include (attributes), and how they connect (relationships).

✅ Think of it like: a map or plan you draw before building your database tables.
