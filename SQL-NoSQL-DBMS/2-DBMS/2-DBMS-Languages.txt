# Database Languages:
  - Database languages are specialized sets of commands and instructions used to define, manipulate and control data within a database. 
  - Each language type plays a distinct role in database management, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval and security of data. 
  - The primary database languages include:

  1. Data Definition Language (DDL):
     - DDL is the short name for Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
      • CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function and triggers)
      • ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
      • DROP: delete objects from the database
      • TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
      • COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
      • RENAME: rename an object

  2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
     - DML focuses on manipulating the data stored in the database, enabling users to retrieve, add, update and delete data.
      • SELECT: retrieve data from a database
      • INSERT: insert data into a table
      • UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
      • DELETE: Delete all records from a database table
      • MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
      • CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
      • EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path
      • LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control

  3. Data Control Language (DCL):
     - DCL commands manage access permissions, ensuring data security by controlling who can perform certain actions on the database.
      • GRANT: Provides specific privileges to a user (e.g., SELECT, INSERT).
      • REVOKE: Removes previously granted permissions from a user.

  4. Transaction Control Language (TCL):
     - TCL commands oversee transactional data to maintain consistency, reliability and atomicity.
      • ROLLBACK: Undoes changes made during a transaction.
      • COMMIT: Saves all changes made during a transaction.
      • SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which one can later roll back.

  5. Data Query Language (DQL)
     - DQL is a subset of DML, specifically focused on data retrieval.
      • SELECT: The primary DQL command, used to query data from the database without altering its structure or contents.
