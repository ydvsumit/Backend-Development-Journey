ðŸ”· What is SCHEMA ?
  - A schema is like the blueprint of your database.
  ðŸ”¥ It describes:
                â€¢ Tables (like "Students", "Courses", "Teachers")
                â€¢ Fields (columns in each table, like name, email, course_id)
                â€¢ Relationships (how tables connect to each other)
                â€¢ Think of it like a map that tells the database how your data is organized.


ðŸ”· What is SCHEMA in SQL ?
    ðŸ”¸ In SQL: 
              â€¢ You can create a schema using: CREATE SCHEMA university;
              â€¢ This will create a new namespace (like a folder) in your database where you can store related tables.

    ðŸ”¸ In PostgreSQL:
                     â€¢ A schema is a namespace inside a database.
                     â€¢ You can have multiple schemas in the same database.

                     â€¢ Example: A university schema could have:
                          â€¢ students table
                          â€¢ courses table
                          â€¢ teachers table

                     â€¢ This helps keep things organized - like having multiple folders inside the same drive.

ðŸ’  Simple Analogy:
  ðŸ“‚ Database = your computer's hard drive
  ðŸ“‚ Schema   = a folder
  ðŸ“‚ Tables   = files inside the folder
