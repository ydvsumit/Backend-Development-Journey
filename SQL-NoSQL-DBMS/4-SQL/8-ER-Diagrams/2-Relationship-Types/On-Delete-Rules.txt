📌 What is On-Delete Rules ?
👉 On-Delete rules (also called ON DELETE actions) are rules in SQL that tell the database what to do with related data when a record is deleted from a parent table.

👉 In simple words:
                    ── They define how the database should handle child records when the parent record they depend on is removed.


🔸 Example:
Let’s say we have two tables:

👉1. Students Table (Parent):
-------------------------------
|   StudentID   |     Name    |
-------------------------------
|       1	      |     John    |
-------------------------------
|       2	      |     Mary    |
-------------------------------


👉2. Enrollments Table (Child)
-------------------------------------------------
|   EnrollmentID  |   StudentID   |    Course   |
-------------------------------------------------
|       101	      |       1       |     Math    |
-------------------------------------------------
|       102	      |       2       |     Science |
-------------------------------------------------

📍 Here, Enrollments.StudentID is a foreign key referring to Students.StudentID.


⚙️ Common ON DELETE Rules:

1. ON DELETE CASCADE:
                      • If a student is deleted, all their related enrollments are also deleted.
                      ✅ Example: Delete John → all his enrollment records (Math) are also deleted automatically.

2. ON DELETE SET NULL:
                      • When the parent row is deleted, the foreign key in the child becomes NULL.
                      ✅ Example: Delete John → his enrollments remain, but StudentID becomes NULL.

3. ON DELETE RESTRICT:
                      • Prevents deletion of the parent if child records exist.
                      ✅ Example: You cannot delete John until his enrollments are deleted first.

4. ON DELETE NO ACTION:
                        • Similar to RESTRICT — the database takes no automatic action,
                          but will give an error if a related child still exists.
                    
5. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT:
                          • When the parent row is deleted, the child’s foreign key is set to a default value (if defined).


💡 In short:
---------------------------------------------------------------
|     Rule        |   What Happens When Parent is Deleted     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|   CASCADE       |   Delete related child rows               |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|   SET NULL      |   Set foreign key to NULL                 |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|   RESTRICT      |   Stop deletion if child exists           |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|   NO ACTION     |   Same as restrict (no automatic change)  |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|   SET DEFAULT   |   Set child foreign key to default value  |
---------------------------------------------------------------


✅ Simple summary:
ON DELETE rules tell the database how to handle related data when the main (parent) record is deleted — either delete, keep, or nullify the child records.
