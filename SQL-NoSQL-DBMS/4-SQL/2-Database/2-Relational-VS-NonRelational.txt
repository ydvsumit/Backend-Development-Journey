ðŸ”¥ Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

ðŸ¦„ Relational Databases (SQL Based):
    â€¢ Data is stored in tables (rows and columns)
    â€¢ Tables can be related to each other using keys (like foreign keys)

  ðŸ‘‰ Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server
  ðŸ‘‰ Use Case: Bank Records, E-Commerce Transactions, etc


ðŸ”· Non-Relational Database (NoSQL Based):
    â€¢ Store data as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.
    â€¢ More flexible but less structured

  ðŸ‘‰ Example: MongoDB, Redis, Firebase
  ðŸ‘‰ Use Case: Real-time apps, chat apps, logging, JSON-based data
