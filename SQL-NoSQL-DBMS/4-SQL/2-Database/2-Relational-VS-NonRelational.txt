🔥 Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

🦄 Relational Databases (SQL Based):
    • Data is stored in tables (rows and columns)
    • Tables can be related to each other using keys (like foreign keys)

  👉 Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server
  👉 Use Case: Bank Records, E-Commerce Transactions, etc


🔷 Non-Relational Database (NoSQL Based):
    • Store data as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.
    • More flexible but less structured

  👉 Example: MongoDB, Redis, Firebase
  👉 Use Case: Real-time apps, chat apps, logging, JSON-based data

  🚀 BONUS:
  🚀 NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational): 
      🔺 Store data in flexible formats, ideal for large volumes of unstructured or rapidly evolving data. 
          📝 Document Databases: Store data as JSON-like documents, useful for content management. 
          📝 Key-Value Databases: Store data as simple key-value pairs, known for fast read/write operations. 
          📝 Wide-Column Stores: Store data in tables with rows and columns, but with a flexible schema where columns can vary per row. 
          📝 Graph Databases: Store data as nodes and edges, excellent for modeling and querying complex relationships, such as in social networks.
