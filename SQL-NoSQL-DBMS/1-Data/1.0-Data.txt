# Data : 
        • Data is the raw material that can be processed for any computing machine. 
        • Data is the raw fact stored in structured or unstructured formats.
        👉 For example − Employee name, Product name, Name of the student, Marks of the student, Mobile number, Image etc.
        ⭐ Note: In a DBMS, data is the raw, unorganized information stored in a database, such as text, numbers, images, or dates. 

# Information: 
              • It is a collection of data. 
              • Information is the data that has been converted into more useful or intelligent form. 
              • It is a processed form of data.
              👉 For example: Report card sheet.

# Structured Data (used in SQL):
  • Structured data in SQL refers to data that is highly organized and formatted in a predefined manner, making it easily searchable, analyzable, manageable, readable and understandable by both humans and machines. 
  • This type of data is typically stored in relational databases, which are managed using a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and accessed through Structured Query Language (SQL).
  • This is achieved through a well-defined schema or data model, where data is stored in an orderly way such as rows and columns.
  
  ⭐Note:
  🌟 Table: A collection of related data organized in rows and columns
  🌟 Row (Record): A single data entry, like one customer or order.
  🌟 Column (Field): A specific attribute such as Name, Email or Age.

  👉 For Example: A customer database might contain structured records with fields like Name, Address, Phone Number, and Email.

🔥 Characteristics of Structured Data:
  • Data conforms to a data model and has easily identifiable structure
  • Stored in tabular form (rows and columns), e.g., relational databases.
  • Data is well organised so, Definition, Format and Meaning of data is explicitly known
  • Data resides in fixed fields within a record or file
  • Data elements are addressable, so efficient to analyse and process

🔥 Common Sources of Structured Data:
  • Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  • Spreadsheets (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets)
  • OLTP Systems (Online Transaction Processing)
  • Online forms and surveys
  • IoT sensors (e.g., GPS, RFID tags)
  • Web and server logs
  • Medical monitoring devices

🔥 Advantages of Structured Data:
  1. Easy to understand and use: Structured data has a well-defined schema or data model, making it easy to understand and use. This allows for easy data retrieval, analysis, and reporting.
  2. Consistency: The well-defined structure of structured data ensures consistency and accuracy in the data, making it easier to compare and analyze data across different sources.
  3. Efficient storage and retrieval: Structured data is typically stored in relational databases, which are designed to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data. This makes it easy to access and process data quickly.
  4. Enhanced data security: Structured data can be more easily secured than unstructured or semi-structured data, as access to the data can be controlled through database security protocols.
  5. Clear data lineage: Structured data typically has a clear lineage or history, making it easy to track changes and ensure data quality.

# Spreadsheet (Basics for data understanding):
  • Spreadsheet is a software to store the data in form of rows and columns. 
  • We can store, arrange, calculate and sort the data. 
  • We can use different formulas and functions in the stored data. 
  • We can add more data in spreadsheet easily because we just need to insert more rows or columns only. 
  • We can create, update and delete data within cells.
  👉 For Examples of spreadsheets are Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and LibreOffice Calc.
